## Rose Windham

Hi.  I am Rose.  I am 9 years old.  The 1st time I surfed, I was 7 years
old.  The 1st competition I was in, I won 2nd place.  At the second
competition, I won 1st place.  I have won 2 trophies and a 1st place
plaque along with numerous medals.


In the 2011 Joe Hiller Longboard Classic, I won 1st place in the
menehune division consisting of 14 and under boys and girls.  I was very
excited.  I have a big plaque on my wall from this victory that says
'first place'.

I like to surf because it is really fun and I meet new people and I love
to be in the water.
