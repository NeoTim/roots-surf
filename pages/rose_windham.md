## Rose Windham

Hi.  I am Rose Widnham.  I am 9 years old.  I was born in Asheville, NC.
I moved from Asheville to Columbia, SC when I was 7 months old.  
I lived there for 5 years and I met very nice people and made some good friends.
Then, my family moved to Chapel Hill for a few years before relocating to Mount Pleasant, SC.

When I learned how to surf, I loved it from the beginning. 
The 1st time I surfed, I was 7 years old.  
The 1st contest I was in, I won 2nd place.
At the second competition, I won 1st place.  
I have won 2 trophies and a 1st place plaque and numerous medals.
This makes me really happy.

In the 2011 Joe Hiller Longboard Classic, I won 1st place in the
menehune division consisting of 14 and under boys and girls.  I was very
excited.  I have a big plaque on my wall from this victory that says
'first place'.

I like to surf because it is really fun and I meet new people and I love
to be in the water.
