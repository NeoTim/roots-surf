## Grace Hanlin

Hi. I am Grace Hanlin.
I am 6 years old.
I was born in Texas, moved to California and now live on James island.


I am just learning to surf and am excited to be part of the team.
Rose and Sylvia Windham are really encouraging me to get out and surf.
I like to surf because I like the ocean and am thrilled about the idea
of being in a few contests.  I have already been part of the push and
surf at the contests and am ready to start surfing with the menehunes.

I think it would be fun to travel around the world and surf big waves.
