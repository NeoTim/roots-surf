## Sylvia Windham

Hi.  I am Sylvia Windham.  I am almost 8 years old.
I was born in Columbia, SC, where I spent the first four years of my life.  
We moved to Chapel Hill, NC and it was very nice, but no waves.  
I am so glad we moved to Charleston, where I learned about surfing. 
The first time I ever surfed I stood up and rode the wave all the way to the sand on my first try.  
The first competition I was ever in, I won 1st place.  
I have some natural talent and think if I
work hard, I may be a good surfer one day.  

I used to bodyboard, but now I surf and I think I am getting better at it.  
It is a tradition for the past few years for my family to go surfing on Christmas day. 
We went on Christmas 2011 and it was very cold because my wetsuit is a little large for me.  
I like surfing much better when the water is warm.  

I am looking forward to the ESA contests and being a part of the 'Roots Surf Team' this year.

I really love Surfing and swimming because I love being in the water!
