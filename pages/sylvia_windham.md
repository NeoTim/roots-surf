## Sylvia Windham

Hi.  I am Sylvia.  I am 8 years old.  The first time I ever surfed I
stood up and rode the wave on my first try.  The first competition I was
ever in, I won 1st place.

I used to bodyboard, but now I surf and I think I am naturally good at
it.  It is a tradition for my family to go surfing on Christmas day. We
went on Christmas 2011 and it was very cold because my wetsuit is a
little large for me.

I love Surfing!!
